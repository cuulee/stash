	<h1>Stash</h1>
	
	<p>
		Stash is a graph-based cache for <a href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="external">Node.js</a>
		powered by <a href="http://redis.io/" rel="external">Redis</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p class="warning">
		Warning! Stash is just a mental exercise at this point. Feedback is very much appreciated, but using it
		in production may cause you to contract ebola or result in global thermonuclear war.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.&rdquo;</p>
		<footer>&mdash; Phil Karlton</footer>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
		One of the most difficult parts about caching is managing dependencies between cache entries. In order to reap
		the benefits of caching, you typically have to
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization" rel="external">denormalize</a> the data that's stored
		in the cache. Since data from child items is then stored within parent items, it can be challenging to figure
		out what entries to invalidate in the cache in response to changes in data.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Here's a concrete example. Consider the following data model, powering a blog:
	</p>
	
	<div class="box diagram">
		<img src="images/data-model.png"/>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		A <strong>Page</strong> can have zero or more <strong>Posts</strong>, each of which can have zero or more
		<strong>Comments</strong>. In order to quickly retrieve the contents of a <strong>Post</strong>, you'll
		want to denormalize its data and cache it. This means that when you store a <strong>Post</strong>, it will
		contain all of its <strong>Comments</strong> &mdash; and when you store a <strong>Page</strong>, it will
		contain all of its <strong>Posts</strong>. Not just the IDs, but the actual data &mdash; otherwise you'd
		have to do multiple cache lookups to reconstitute the parent objects, and the point of the cache is to
		speed up the loading process.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Here's some sample data representing a couple of <strong>Posts</strong>, each with <strong>Comments</strong>,
		rolled up into a <strong>Page</strong>.
	</p>
	
<pre class="box"><code>comment1 = { id: "comment1", author: "John Doe", text: "What an interesting post!" };
comment2 = { id: "comment2", author: "Jane Doe", text: "I know, right? I should become a writer." };
post1 = {
  id: "post1",
  author: "Jane Doe",
  text: "Here's a post. It's fascinating."
  comments: [comment1, comment2]
};
comment3 = { id: "comment3", author: "John Doe", text: "Yeah, this post is boring. Don't quit your day job." };
post2 = {
  id: "post2",
  author: "Jane Doe",
  text: "Here's another post, which is not nearly as fascinating.",
  comments: [comment3]
};
page1 = {
  id: "page1",
  posts: [post1, post2]
};
</pre></code>
	
	<p>
		To cache this information, we can serialize it to a format like
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" rel="external">JSON</a>. This is what <code>page1</code> would
		look like after being serialized:
	</p>
	
<pre class="box"><code>{
  "id": "page1",
  "posts": [
    "id": "post1",
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "text": "Here's a post. It's fascinating.",
    "comments": [{
      "id": "comment1",
      "author": "John Doe",
      "text": "What an interesting post!"
    },{
      "id": "comment2",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "text": "I know, right? I should become a writer."
    }]
  },{
    "id": "post2",
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "text": "Here's another post, which is not nearly as fascinating.",
    "comments": [{
      "id": "comment3",
      "author": "John Doe",
      "text": "Yeah, this post is boring. Don't quit your day job."
    }]
  }]
}</code></pre>

	<p>
		This denormalization means that you'll be able to retrieve all of the data necessary to display the <strong>Post</strong>
		with a single lookup.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, it also means that if someone edits one of the <strong>Comments</strong>, the data stored for the
		<strong>Post</strong> becomes stale. Likewise, when someone edits one of the <strong>Posts</strong>, the data stored
		for the <strong>Page</strong> becomes stale. In order to ensure that you are serving correct data, your application
		must remove the stale data from the cache.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Stash helps to solve this problem by representing your cache entries as a
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph" rel="external">directed graph</a> of dependencies. If you
		consider the relationship of dependencies in our example, it looks like this:
	</p>
	
	<div class="box diagram">
		<img src="images/invalidation-1.png"/>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		Let's say John comes along and edits his first comment. This means that the data stored at this position is no
		longer valid, and should be removed from the cache:
	</p>
	
	<div class="box diagram">
		<img src="images/invalidation-2.png"/>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		That's not too hard, but since we decided to denormalize the data for <code>comment1</code> into <code>post1</code>
		and <code>page1</code>, we have to remove those items from the cache as well. When you invalidate an entry,
		Stash will walk the dependency graph and remove any dependent entries from the cache as well. In this case,
		Stash would remove the following subtree from the graph, leaving the rest alone:
	</p>
	
	<div class="box diagram">
		<img src="images/invalidation-3.png"/>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		Even when an item is invalidated, Stash remembers the dependencies between them, so you only need to alter the
		dependency graph when the relationships between your items change, not when the data changes.
	</p>
	
	<h2>API</h2>

	<p>
		All callbacks use the standard Node.js convention of <code>(err, data)</code>.
	</p>

	<div class="api">
		<code>new Stash( config )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Creates a new instance of <code>Stash</code> and connects to Redis. Configuration options may include:
		<ul>
			<li><code>host</code> &mdash; the hostname or IP address of the Redis server to connect to</li>
			<li><code>port</code> &mdash; the port name of the Redis server to connect to</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<div class="api">
		<code>get( key, callback )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Gets the item stored at the specified key.
	</p>

	<div class="api">
		<code>set( key, value, [callback] )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Sets the value stored at the specified key. If a <code>callback</code> is specified, it will be called after
		the item is set.
	</p>
	
	<div class="api">
		<code>dep( key, dependencies..., [callback] )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Declares that the value stored at <code>key</code> depends on values stored at the keys specified in
		<code>dependencies</code>. The dependencies may be either an array, or varargs, or a combination of both.
		If a <code>callback</code> is specified, it will be called after the dependencies are created.
	</p>
	
	<div class="api">
		<code>inv( keys..., [callback] )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Declares that the value stored at each key in <code>keys</code> is no longer valid and should be removed
		from the cache. The keys may be either an array, or varargs, or a combination of both. If a <code>callback</code>
		is specified, it will be called with an array of keys that were removed from the cache.
	</p>
	
	<div class="api">
		<code>rem( keys..., [callback] )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Removes the entries stored at each key in <code>keys</code> from the cache. This differs from <code>inv()</code>
		in that it does not remove dependent items, and destroys the edges of the graph related to the items. Use this
		when an item no longer exists, and won't be added to the cache again. If a <code>callback</code> is specified,
		it will be called after the items are removed.
	</p>
	
	<div class="api">
		<code>quit( [force] )</code>
	</div>
	<p class="api">
		Disconnects from Redis. If you want to disconnect immediately and terminate in-flight requests, pass
		<code>true</code> for <code>force</code>.
	</p>
